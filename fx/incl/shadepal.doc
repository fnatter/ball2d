description of 16 basecolors of shadepal are created (shadelin.pal + shadecos.pal)

imagine the color spectrum as a volume of a cube of (unit-cube, V = 1.0)
this cube is offset in a cartesian coordinate system with axes r, g and b
so that one edge of the cube becomes the center of the coordinate system and
the three adjacent edges are colinear with the three axes

to get the most diversity of colors we can approximate with the palettes,
i choose 12 basecolors which lie close to the planes that do not share
the origin of the coordinate system (4 for each). I don't put them on the planes
but rather all on a parallel plane, because that way we cover more colors with them -
if they'd lie on the planes which are faces of the cube, they would be as bright as possible
in r, g and/or b, which would prevent that they cover brighter colors with their bounding Sphere
(the volume of their bounding Sphere being a representation of the spectrum of colors the palette entry covers).

these should also have some spacing from the planes
additionally, i choose (1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) as the four
remaining basecolors (values in r, g, b, respectively)

-> the twelve first basecolors: (spacing is the distance between the parallel plane and the plane which is a face of the cube)

on a plane parallel to the gr-plane
(0.25, 0.75, 1.0 - spacing)
(2/3, 2/3, 1.0 - spacing)
(1/3, 1/3, 1.0 - spacing)
(0.75, 0.25, 1.0 - spacing)

on a plane parallel to the gb-plane
(1.0 - spacing, 0.25, 0.75)
(1.0 - spacing, 2/3, 2/3)
(1.0 - spacing, 0.75, 0.25)
(1.0 - spacing, 1/3, 1/3)

on a plane parallel to the br-plane
(1/3, 1.0 - spacing, 1/3)
(0.75, 1.0 - spacing, 0.25)
(0.25, 1.0 - spacing, 0.75)
(2/3, 1.0 - spacing, 2/3)
