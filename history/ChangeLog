	* v1.1/ball2d.c: add polygonal obstacles

2011-08-10 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>
	* v1.0beta2/ball2d.c: re-implement -zombies

2011-08-06 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>
	* v1.0beta1/ball2d.c: add obstacle collisions, now all collisions
          seem to work, feature complete :-)
	* v1.0beta1/ball2d_(overlap|lookahead).c: fix findObstacleIntersection()

2011-08-06 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>
	* rename ball2d.c to ball2d_overlap.c (iterative variant with
	  ball-overlap)
	* keep ball2d_lookahead.c (iterative variant without ball-overlap)
	* rename ball2d_pi.c to ball2d.c (path intersection variant)
	* ball2d.c is @v1.0beta1 (now main branch!)

2011-08-06 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>
	ball2d_pi-v0.2.c
	* Lagging fixed by:
	  1. measuring the time needed for Balls_move and subtracting that
	     from the screenhack delay!
	  2. making sure that all balls for moved for delta_t=SINGLE_TIME_STEP,
	     even if a collision occurs in between!

2011-08-04 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>
	ball2d_pi-v0.1.c:
	* first version of "path intersection" (analytic) approach
	* supports (perfect :-) ball collisions and wall hits
	* Lagging :-(
	* needs optimization: don't compute all path intersections!

2011-07-31 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>
	v0.11/*
	* Balls_findPathIntersection() now uses an equation derived by
	  maxima (GPL!), but the version in v0.10 derived by "Derive"
	  is more efficient (less operations) :-(
	* -showFutureCollisions now honors walls and obstacles, but
	  (still) seems to be a bit buggy (even without obstacles)

2011-07-28 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>
	ball2d-v0.10.c, ball2d_lookahead-v0.10.c
	* show the point where the two balls will touch with a cross
	* still the problem is that -showFutureCollisons does not honor
	  walls and obstacles!

2011-07-27 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>
	ball2d-v0.9.c, ball2d_lookahead-v0.9.c
	* revive the lookahead version (check for future ball collisions to
	  avoid overlap). Cleaner because it doesn't require "move apart"
	* add Feature -showFutureCollisions which highlights the two balls that
	  will next collide

2011-07-24 Felix Natter <fnatter@gmx.net>
	ball2d-v0.8.c: no more collision bugs :-)
	* Ball-Ball-Collisions: do not reset way_to_go after collisions
	  (not necessary anymore because cball->EOFiteration = False
	   is NOT done when the collision was aborted because there
	   was no other event between the last collision with the same
	   ball)
	* Ball-Obstacle-Collisions: do not use the 45Â° virtual wall 
	  approximation any more. Instead, create a virtual wall
	  which is normal to the vector between the obstacle corner
	  and the center of the ball
